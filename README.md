Overview
Lots of financial losses are caused every year due to credit card fraud transactions, the financial industry has switched from a posterior investigation approach to an a priori predictive approach with the design of fraud detection algorithms to warn and help fraud investigators.

This case study is focused to give you an idea of applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics and understand how data can be utilized in order to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

Business Problem Understanding
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their inadequate or missing credit history. Some consumers use this to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Let us consider your work for a consumer finance company that specialises in lending various types of loans to customers. You must use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyse the patterns present in the data which will make sure that the loans are not rejected for the applicants capable of repaying.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to rights for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s or company’s decision:

If the aspirant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan tends in a business loss to the company
If the a is aspirant not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default/fraud, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
The data contains information about the loan application.

When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the bank/company:

# Business Goal #

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
